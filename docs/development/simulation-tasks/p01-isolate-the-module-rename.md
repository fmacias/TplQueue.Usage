# P01 - Isolate the module rename

Status: pending.

[Back to the task checklist](../simulation-use-case-plan.md#task-checklist)

## Thread scope and completion

Execute only this task in this thread. Follow the main plan's
[one-task-per-thread workflow](../simulation-use-case-plan.md#one-task-per-thread).
After acceptance passes, update this task's status and execution record, check its
entry in the main plan, and include those updates in the local task commit(s).
Verify the commits succeeded before reporting completion. If blocked, record the
blocker and leave the main checkbox unchecked. End with commit hashes, validation
results and the next eligible task's file path and prompt for a new thread.
Stop there; do not start another task or push commits.

## Dependencies

[P00](p00-record-decisions-and-establish-baseline.md). The rename may be deferred; scenario work can use the current module name.

## Scope

When implementing the intended rename,
  update project/namespace references, solutions, scripts, test links and affected
  documentation together. Preserve behavior and verify old references deliberately
  retained for history. Inventory workspace consumers before touching them; apply
  their instructions if they are affected. Do not infer a contracts-project rename.
  Suggested commit: `refactor(samples): rename ETL implementation to simulation`.

## Working rules and validation

Read the [main plan](../simulation-use-case-plan.md) before starting. Its
[common implementation rules](../simulation-use-case-plan.md#common-implementation-rules),
[iteration workflow](../simulation-use-case-plan.md#iteration-workflow-and-definition-of-done),
[validation entry points](../simulation-use-case-plan.md#validation-entry-points) and
[additional automated coverage](../simulation-use-case-plan.md#additional-automated-coverage)
apply to this task. Resolve only decisions needed by this task and include the
relevant tests, documentation and acceptance evidence in the same iteration.

## Execution record

Pending. When work starts, copy the main plan's
[iteration record template](../simulation-use-case-plan.md#iteration-record) here.
Record exact checks, outcomes, skipped checks and blockers. Update the task status
and the main checklist together; mark complete only after acceptance passes.
